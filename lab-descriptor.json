  "introduction": "In this lab, students will be able to learn and practice basic python programming. Students can expand their skillset by learning and solving basic problems in python. Python is very easy to use, powerful, and versatile. It has become the language of choice for many IoT developers. One of the main reasons for the popularity of Python is the developer community. Python developers have created and made available many specific modules that can be imported into any program to immediately lend added functionality.  Python is a high-level programming language. It is easy for beginners to learn and widely utilized in many scientific areas for data assessment. This lab is an overview of the Python programming language for learners without prior programming knowledge. It follows the concept of object-oriented programming and has graphical user interface-driven applications. The examples and difficulties used in this lab are drawn from numerous areas like text processing, simple graphics creation, and image manipulation, Data Science and visualization, Desktop GUI, hypertext mark-up language, and web development.",
